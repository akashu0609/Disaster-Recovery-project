# Disaster-Recovery-project
built a CI/CD pipeline where code from GitHub is deployed to an S3 bucket with versioning enabled, fronted by CloudFront for global delivery. If a file accidentally deleted, can be restored instantly from version history without downtime. Setup also uses Route 53 for DNS and Jenkins for automation, ensuring both performance and disaster recovery.
